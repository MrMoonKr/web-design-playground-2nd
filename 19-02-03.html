        <h2>The Descendant Combinator</h2>
            <p>
                Yep, a space is a head-scratching character choice to define a CSS selector, but thatâ€™s not about to change.
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>
                    In CSS lingo, the character that you place between two elements to form a selector is called a <dfn>combinator</dfn>. The combinator for the descendant selector is a space, and it just seems odd to use whitespace to define something so fundamental. Even odder is the fact that you can use <em>any</em> whitespace character, such as a tab or a carriage return. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A while back, there was a brief movement to change that by introducing an explicit descendant combinator: the double greater-than sign (for example, <code>div >> p</code> instead of <code>div p</code>). This emininently sensible idea never took off, unfortunately.
